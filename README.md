Word Guess Game
=============================
A simple hangman style game that I made, the theme is Game of Thrones. The word will be randomly chosen (think Game of Thrones characters and places!) and you have to guess its letters.

## How to play
To play, simply enter in a letter with your keyboard, and the game will tell you whether the letter you guessed was a part of the word or not and adjust your score accordingly. If you run out of guesses, you lose!
